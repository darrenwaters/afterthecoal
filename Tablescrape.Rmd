Load the libraries that will do the hard work of scraping a HTMTL table
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
content <- read_html("https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10084647/cube/HOUS_DENSITY_GEN")
tables <- content %>% html_table(fill = TRUE)
```
The scrape created a list of two tables - one of which is the one I want. Now I create a dataframe of just that table.
```{r}
first_table <- tables[[1]]
```
